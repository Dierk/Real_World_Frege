Real World Frege
================

Examples of the book ["Real World Haskell"](http://book.realworldhaskell.org) in the [Frege](http://www.frege-lang.org) programming language.

You can freely read the book online under
http://book.realworldhaskell.org
and the examples provided here should help you
to compare Haskell with Frege in terms of the book.

This project is supposed to help
* Java developers to learn yourself some Haskell/Frege for great good
* Haskell developers to show how to use their skills on the JVM

Contributions and pull requests for this effort are more than welcome!

As a Java developer who wants to learn Haskell/Frege this is really
the best way forward: writing some code.
By contributing to this project, you not only write _some_ code.
You write code that's purpose and meaning is well documented while
at the same time you are paving the way for your followers.

Contributions can be as small as one single example.

Let's make the world a better place - one commit at a time.
